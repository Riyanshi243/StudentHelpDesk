# StudentHelpDesk
An Android App, The app is aimed to help the placement cell and students to review and change the data in real time.
Often it happens that placement cell urgently needs data of students but students are not availaible at the moment.
Or for student to change an information as fickle as their phone number, have to write mails to the placement cells.
Placement cell sends long form every few months to students for their updated information which is a tedious task.
Our app solved all these problems by providing a single platform to both students and admins to view review and change data.
We also have notifications to be sent to students from administration.
